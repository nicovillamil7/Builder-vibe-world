This article highlights how <strong>laminate flooring</strong> resists <strong>wear</strong>, retains beauty, minimizes upkeep, and why professional installation is key to its lasting performance.</p><h2>What Makes <strong>Laminate Flooring</strong> a Durable Flooring Choice?</h2><p><strong>Laminate flooring</strong> is built with multiple layers including a robust <strong>wear</strong> layer, a high-density core, and photographic layers that replicate natural textures.
