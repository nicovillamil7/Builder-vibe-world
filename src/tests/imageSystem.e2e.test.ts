// This file has been replaced by:
// - src/utils/imageSystemDiagnostics.ts (browser-compatible diagnostics)
// - src/tests/imageSystem.vitest.test.ts (actual Vitest test suite)
//
// The original file was causing Vitest import errors when used in browser context.
// Use the Test Runner component (/image-system-tests) for browser-based testing.
// Use `npm run test` with the .vitest.test.ts file for actual Vitest testing.
